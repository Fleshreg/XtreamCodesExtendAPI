# XtreamCodesExtendAPI
Xtream Codes 1.6 - Extend API Functionality

Poorly written extension to Xtream Codes 1.60 to allow player_api.php to be implemented. This will allow the WHMCS Web TV Player and Xtream Codes API based Android / iOS players to have limited functionality with the older Xtream Codes panel.


!BETA - INCOMPLETE!


FEATURES
--------
- Decoded Xtream Codes 2x API backported to 1.6
- Live TV, EPG and VOD functionality reimplemented
- CORS implementation in NGINX

LIMITATIONS
-----------
- No TV Series support in 1.6x
- No Catchup support in 1.6x

FUTURE PLANS
------------
- Implement TV Series support manually

INSTALLATION
------------
- Just extract the files to /home/xtreamcodes/iptv_xtream_codes and overwrite.
